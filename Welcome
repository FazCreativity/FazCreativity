Hi! I'm Faz Creativity! I'm a 15 year old Software Developer, specifically working with Unreal Engine 5.
I've loved coding for years, so I'm glad I can show my progress to everyone!

I've released a few projects so far and I am excited to release more

1. ConstructHome
2. Operation Hacksaw

I'm currently working on a few large projects, which will be completed at an unknown date. 

1. Revolt - Shelfed For Now
2. ForkKnife Kitchen Royale - PreDevelopment
3. Breach: Frontal Assault - Shelfed For Now
4. Breach: Disruption- PreDevelopment

I'll be happy to share more information with these projects when they are in a state I am willing to show
