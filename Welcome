Hi! I'm Faz Creativity! I'm a 15 year old Software Developer, specifically working with Unreal Engine 5.
I've loved coding for years, so I'm glad I can show my progress to everyone!

I've released only one project so far, which was completed in 24 hours and for my Math Final

1. ConstructHome

I'm currently working on a few large projects, which will be completed at an unknown date. 

1. Project Revolt - Active Development
2. ForkKnife Kitchen Royale - PreDevelopment
3. Breach: Disrupted - PreDevelopment
4. Tactics: High Stakes - PreDevelopment

I'll be happy to share more information with these projects when they are in a state I am willing to show
